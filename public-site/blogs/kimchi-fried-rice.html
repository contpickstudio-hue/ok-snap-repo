        <h2>Step-by-Step: Crafting Kimchi Fried Rice</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by heating a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup of chopped, well-fermented kimchi. Stir-fry until fragrant and slightly caramelized, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>If desired, add some diced pork or beef, cooking until browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in 2 cups of cold, leftover rice (day-old rice works best!).</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of gochujang (Korean chili paste) for that extra spicy kick, mixing everything thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Finish with a dash of sesame oil and a sprinkle of sesame seeds for nutty depth.</li>
            <li>Top with a fried, sunny-side-up egg for a creamy touch, letting the yolk mix into the rice just before you take that first bite.</li>
        </ol>
