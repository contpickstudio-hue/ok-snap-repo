            <h2>Realizing the Perfect Seasoned Cockles at Home</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Rinse the Cockles:</strong> Start with fresh cockles, rinsing them under cold water to remove sand and grit. Let them sit in salted water for about 30 minutes, allowing them to expel any remaining impurities.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of gochugaru, 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, and a teaspoon of sugar. Stir until the mixture is well-blended.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the Cockles:</strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the cockles just until they open, about 3–5 minutes. Immediately transfer them to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine and Serve:</strong> Drain the cockles and toss them in the prepared marinade. Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds. Serve with a side of steamed rice and enjoy!</li>
