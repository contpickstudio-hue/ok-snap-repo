## Deployment

This website is designed to be fully static and can be deployed to:
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Vercel
- Any static hosting service

### Vercel Deployment

If deploying to Vercel from a separate branch:

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to Project Settings → General
   - Set **Root Directory** to `public-site`
   - Set **Build Command** to empty (or `echo "No build needed"`)
   - Set **Output Directory** to `.` (current directory)
   - Set **Install Command** to empty

2. **Or use the included `vercel.json`:**
   - The `vercel.json` in this directory is already configured
   - Make sure Vercel is reading from the correct branch
   - The config handles blog post routing automatically

3. **Branch-specific settings:**
   - If using a separate branch, configure that branch in Vercel
   - Set the root directory to `public-site` for that branch only

## Blog Posts

Blog posts are automatically generated by the OK-Snap app and saved to the `blogs/` directory. Each blog post is an SEO-optimized HTML file with:

- Proper meta tags
- Structured content
- Mobile-responsive design
- SEO-friendly URLs

## Recipes JSON

The `recipes.json` file is automatically updated when new blog posts are generated. It contains:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Dish Name",
    "slug": "dish-name",
    "url": "https://yourdomain.com/blogs/dish-name.html",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

## Customization

To customize the domain URL in recipes.json, update the `updateRecipesJson` function in `api/generate-blog.js`.
